    Parser class is a parent class which is inherited by all the other parsers classes.
    The main purpose of this parser class is to parse user expression.
    For Example:-
    If user gives "English + Math As Total" as an expression,
    1. this class helps to split and store parsed result
    2. add score of English & Math
    3. Store it as 'Total' in entity subject

    It's child classes are responsible of parsing different data into entity collection
